# Inconsistent "Template" name upon export

When exporting a DMP, some of the information on the printed cover page seems inconsistent.

## Expected behaviour:

When exporting a DMP, the printed "Template" name on the cover page should match the name of the template used when creating the DMP.

## Actual behaviour:

In some cases, the funder or the organisation is printed as "Template" name instead of the actual template.

## Steps to reproduce:

"Students Behaviour towards Research" (should be Population Research Committee Template but prints "Mr Dimakatso Pilusa")
"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robot Hand-Eye Coordination" (should be DCC template but prints "Edge Hill University")
"FARSYD - FArming SYstems as tool to support policies for effective conservation and management of high nature value farmlanDs" (should be DCC template but prints "European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) & the Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT)")
